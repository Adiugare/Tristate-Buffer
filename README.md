# Tristate-Buffer

Definition:
A tristate buffer is a type of electronic circuit that can operate in three distinct states:
Logic High (1): Passes a high signal.
Logic Low (0): Passes a low signal.
High-Impedance (Z): Disconnects the output from the circuit, creating isolation.

Key Feature:
The high-impedance state prevents the buffer from interfering with other components connected to the same data line or bus.

Use: For shared communication systems, like buses, where several devices must connect without interfering with each other's signals.
 
Mechanism of Control:
 There is an enable pin that controls it:
 
 It transmits signals (logic 1 or 0) when it is enabled.
 It switches to high-impedance mode when it is disabled.

 Uses:
 Microprocessors: Controlling how information moves between the processor and its accessories.
 Memory Systems: Regulating ROM or RAM access.
 Data buses: Keeping many devices from colliding while they communicate.
